Welcome to Creepy Tree Productions!

Here are some of the games we are currently working on:

### Grim Souls

Being in middle management can be hard, especially when you work for Hades.
Ever since you were promoted to Stygian Safety Coordinator, senior management
has ignored your warnings about safe population levels. But when overcrowding
causes an explosion, releasing souls into the overworld, you're held responsible
for cleaning it up and returning all the souls to the underworld!

### Necromance

You just got recruited into a necromancer's army. So what's the first
thing you should do? Look for a date, of course! 

Flirt with a vampire! Cuddle with a succubus! Smooch a skeleton! Who
knew being undead could be so much fun?
